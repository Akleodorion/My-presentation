Hello, I'm Christian ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73429254/227010534-4c93813b-3056-469c-b0b7-0407882a480b.png)

I'm a former engineer, and I've just began my journey as a web developer.
I am located in France at the moment but firmly intend to go abroad some day. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73429254/227011307-139b3036-5e6b-4559-bfad-2362866f0c69.png)

I've spend the last couple of month working on Ruby and it's framework Rails in which i'm starting to get confident.
I'll take the the time to upload some of the projects I've been included in and some of the others i've worked on.

  - My main skill is on Ruby but can easily code in HTML,CSS & JS.
  - I have found my way into coding via Dart & Flutter in which i trully believe for mobile development.
  - I would be glad to join some community to work on inspiring projects may they be in web dev or mobile, feel free to contact me at my socials. 

Languages and Tools I work with :
html5 css3 ruby rails bootstrap figma git heroku postgresql
